# Deployment handoff

## Admin visibility fix — 2026-10-01

The Users hierarchy previously rendered only client-owned groups, hiding bidders
whose workspace owner is an admin (for example, after promoting a client).
Production investigation confirmed one such bidder, with a valid membership.
Users now includes a searchable **Bidders without a client** section in the admin
Active/Archived views, using the existing detail links and management actions.
No migration, reassignment, or permission change is required.

Verification: the browser regression failed before the fix and passed afterward;
77 unit/database tests, 44 desktop/mobile browser tests, lint, type checking, and
the production build passed. Preview `dpl_2jHuMLsf58SvDquhPYnsSW1aVMYH` passed the
targeted hosted check for finding, editing rates, and opening the bidder profile.
`scripts/people-visibility-smoke.mjs` creates and removes only synthetic staging
accounts and refuses to run against production.

Production deployment `dpl_7iwTycA81doPV3QKL6mqPSmRXgwq` is READY at
https://bidder-check.vercel.app. A temporary admin session confirmed that the
previously hidden bidder appears, is searchable, and opens both the management
dialog and detail page. No production account data was edited; that verification
session was signed out afterward. This release was deployed from the working tree.

Production is deployed at https://bidder-check.vercel.app and isolated Preview at https://bidder-check-staging.vercel.app. Production uses Supabase `aizorlyfggwbewetnwqm`; staging uses `kdmvludtvhuuewmhurpw`. Both have the application schema and private Storage. The designated account `david.chan.mdev@gmail.com` has been assigned the admin role.

The direct-account onboarding update is live. It replaces emailed bidder invitations with manager-created accounts (initial password `123456`), supports password changes in Settings, and signs clients in immediately after registration. SMTP is outside the revised scope. Production and staging have migrations 001–003, with all eight tables under RLS and a private file bucket.

## Review, interview reporting, and scheduled notifications

Migrations `202610050001`–`202610050003` add review-gated screenshot submission, interview tracking with retention-safe reporting, scheduled client messages, bidder inbox records, per-device push subscriptions, and atomic bulk review. The bid grid exposes the all-dates Pending review queue, per-column controls, and user-specific page size. `/interviews` reports first-application cohorts; `/notifications` manages schedules or the bidder inbox.

Notification delivery requires the separate SQL scripts under `supabase/scheduler/notifications-*.sql`. Configure `NOTIFICATION_WORKER_SECRET` in the matching Vercel environment, then create Vault secrets for that deployment's `/api/cron/notifications` URL and the same bearer value. On Vercel deployments protected by authentication, also store the deployment-protection bypass in that environment's Vault. Run the notification function script before its schedule script; the job invokes the worker every minute. Keep staging and production VAPID keys and push subscriptions separate.

Browser push is optional. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `VAPID_SUBJECT` in the matching Vercel environment; generate a pair with `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`. Without these values, scheduled messages still publish to the in-app inbox. On iPhone/iPad, install Bidder Check to the home screen before enabling browser notifications. SMTP remains disabled.

Staging acceptance completed on 2026-10-05. The three migrations are applied to `kdmvludtvhuuewmhurpw`; Preview deployment `dpl_BoziLmFsTm2s9WYhDV6jFbFezApB` is READY at `https://bidder-check-lm3yco1wo-devtech06130324s-projects.vercel.app`. The staging notification Cron runs every minute, its Vault endpoint targets that deployment, and a worker invocation returned HTTP 200. The hosted suite passed all 20 checkpoints, including approval-gated screenshot upload, selected-recipient inbox delivery/read state, interview conversion, retention and reset cleanup; it removed its synthetic accounts and confirmed the cutover gate is off. Local lint, type checking, 87 unit tests, 41 database tests, and the production build pass.

Production migrations `202610050001` through `202610050003` were applied on 2026-10-05 through the authenticated Supabase CLI passwordless login flow; the production ledger matches local through `202610050003`. Production deployment `dpl_DfCtanwpjbKGLLkuaHySpyLn7Q5m` is READY at https://bidder-check.vercel.app. Scheduled in-app notifications are configured: `NOTIFICATION_WORKER_SECRET` is a sensitive Vercel Production variable, the endpoint URL, worker secret, and deployment-protection bypass are stored in Supabase Vault, and `bidder-check-notifications` runs every minute. Production worker verification returned HTTP 200 with no network error on 2026-10-05. Vercel deployment protection remains enabled. Browser push is optional; its VAPID keys are not configured, and real-device push was not exercised. These migrations are additive; do not run a production data reset.

## Required access

Use `.env.local` for local secrets; `.gitignore` excludes it. Keep secrets out of chat and Git.

Management/deployment tokens are not runtime variables and must not be sent to browsers or installed in the Vercel application environment.

## Release order

1. Inspect migration history; apply checked-in migrations in order with `supabase db push`. Do not rerun the initial SQL over an existing schema.
2. Set `auth.email.enable_confirmations = false`. Keep SMTP disabled. Configure the environment's Site URL without overwriting unrelated provider settings.
3. Keep staging and production data isolated; apply and test migrations on staging first.
4. Import the GitHub repository into Vercel: Next.js, root `./`, Node `22.x`, `npm run build`, default output. Use `main` for production.
5. Add the four runtime environment variables separately to Production and Preview; previews use staging credentials.
6. Set the production `APP_URL` and Supabase Site URL to the assigned Vercel/custom domain; add `/auth/confirm` and `/auth/callback` to the redirect allowlist. Redeploy if environment variables changed.
7. Admin bootstrap is already complete. For another explicitly authorized administrator, register the account first, then run the bootstrap command with its email.
8. Run `scripts/hosted-smoke.mjs` against staging: immediate signup, direct bidder creation, initial-password login/change, two-client isolation, private downloads, invalid/valid screenshot uploads, correction/reapplication, retry idempotency and archival. The script cleans its synthetic users and files. Check deployment logs without logging profile/file contents.

Verification on 2026-09-29: 20 unit/database cases, 14 desktop/mobile browser cases, lint, typecheck and production build all passed. The full hosted Vercel staging journey passed all eight workflow checkpoints: immediate signup; bidder creation/default-password login/password change; private resumes; invalid screenshot rejection; valid evidence and earnings; direct HTTP tenant/storage permissions; correction/new-proof/retry behavior; earnings and archival. Synthetic accounts/files were cleaned up. Email delivery is intentionally not tested or required.

Application commit `ffd5474` reached READY in production (`dpl_4rJ8zXEdvLHPVYx72AkmES2sRcKF`) and staging (`dpl_Bc3FTUdih6hF46PtxXDyMiJUCeVS`). Subsequent documentation/test-runner commits may create equivalent deployments through the GitHub integration.

Post-release production checks passed: protected routes redirect to login, updated signup/recovery pages render on mobile without overflow, Supabase reports immediate signup enabled, and the designated administrator remains active. Production checks were read-only; complete data-mutation journeys ran on staging.

## Approval and bid workflow release ? 2026-09-30

The new application is verified on staging at commit `a247b2d`, deployment `dpl_9vdxHy9Du3yZXQaN56yXekLB8D9Y`. Migrations 004, 005, 006 and 202609300001 add client approval, account/email synchronization, atomic evidence application, recoverable trash and blocked-account settings restrictions. Earlier immediate-workspace onboarding is superseded: public client sessions now land on approval status until approved; SMTP remains unnecessary.

Release validation: 32 unit/database tests, 16 desktop/mobile browser tests, lint/type checking and production build passed. All 13 hosted staging checkpoints passed: pending/signup restrictions; rejection/approval; admin client create/archive/restore; synchronized email and confirmed password resets; bidder creation/login/password change; private resumes; invalid screenshot rejection; automatic application and replacement; direct tenant/storage restrictions; correction/reapplication/rate/idempotency; trash/restoration; parent archival/restoration; individual archival and retained earnings. Synthetic staging accounts/files were cleaned up.

Post-release verification uses `node --env-file=.env.local scripts/production-smoke.mjs`. It checks the designated admin without editing it, creates one synthetic pending client, verifies approval routing and password change, then removes exactly that generated account. No customer records are changed and no email is sent.

## Spreadsheet bid workflow - 2026-09-30

The spreadsheet application at commit `276bd13` is verified on staging, deployment `dpl_7k1uyA9Fx9FAbbfcfS888Htg5uhV`, and assigned to https://bidder-check-staging.vercel.app. It adds inline field editing, copy-only rectangular selection, mapped Sheets imports, and Yesterday (CT). Migrations `202609300002_spreadsheet_bids.sql` and `202609300003_url_canonicalization.sql` add version-checked mutations, actor-scoped import receipts, transactional import validation, and canonical duplicate keys. The normalization migration aborts on a historical collision instead of deleting records.

Release checks: 44 unit/database tests and 34 desktop/mobile browser checks passed, plus lint, type checking and production build. Coverage includes a 500-row preview and database transaction, Unicode/multiline clipboard values, conflicts, focus, filtered row removal, permissions, receipts, Chicago midnight and DST boundaries. The full hosted staging run passed 14 checkpoints, including an actual past-date Sheets import and inline edit, simultaneous edits, concurrent retries, and complete duplicate-batch rollback. Existing account, proof, earnings, trash and archive journeys also passed. All synthetic staging users/files were removed.

The test runner uses network-appropriate assertion timeouts. An initial staging run successfully imported/edited rows but used an incorrect accessible-name locator for the separate Saved status; that locator was corrected. A subsequent run hit a five-second upload-verification assertion while the upload was still completing; a 45-second network assertion limit resolved it. These were test-runner corrections; the final full run exited successfully.

Production smoke checks also verify that pending accounts cannot call the new spreadsheet RPCs or read import receipts. No SMTP configuration or new runtime environment variables are required.

Production release: commit `85a755b` reached READY at deployment `dpl_8QKRL5KLJ4MZ32EuLmjmtkLExKuK` on https://bidder-check.vercel.app. Both spreadsheet migrations applied successfully. Post-release production checks passed: designated admin remains active, public metadata cannot grant approval/roles, pending accounts cannot access workspace data or spreadsheet RPCs/receipts, and approval routing, password change and sign-out work. The synthetic production verification account was removed. Later documentation-only commits may create equivalent deployments through Git integration.

## Bulk controls and permanent trash deletion

Migration `202609300004_bulk_bid_controls.sql` adds actor-bound confirmation snapshots, version-checked bulk actions, durable screenshot cleanup, and SHA-256 import receipt fingerprints. Apply on staging before production; completed import retries never recreate purged rows. Selected operations are capped at 500; Empty trash uses the full authorized scope, with fixed-bidder pages remaining scoped.

Set a distinct server-only `CRON_SECRET` in Preview and Production. `vercel.json` schedules `/api/cron/storage-cleanup` daily at 05:00 UTC. Preview does not automatically run Vercel cron: exercise the route with the staging bearer secret. The worker processes at most 50 files per call, leases tasks for two minutes, retains failed tasks, and requires a second successful removal at least five minutes after the first. Application deletion is immediate; screenshot cleanup stays pending until verified. Managers can retry pending work in the app. Resume objects are never enqueued. Large backlogs drain across bounded manual/daily passes.

Hosted smoke tests create their own staging accounts and purge only those synthetic applications. They simulate an upload finishing after the initial delete, invoke authenticated cron, verify its physical object is removed, and clean their own operation/task records. Production smoke checks pending-account denial for the new RPCs without purging customer data.

Verified staging release: commit `9b5b27c`, deployment `dpl_8zJb28uuw7JzzWcZCEu4NYEfWZNs`. All 16 hosted checkpoints passed and generated accounts/files were removed. Local verification: 51 unit/database cases, 40 browser cases, lint/type checking and production build. A fresh review's pending-cleanup discovery issue was fixed with a failing-then-passing regression before staging.

Production release `161d372` reached READY as `dpl_6ABnUrWGAcXWpN8vYfY5XCv97spK` at https://bidder-check.vercel.app. Migration 202609300004 is applied in both environments. Post-release checks passed: designated admin remains active, signup metadata cannot grant privileges, pending accounts are denied all new bulk/purge RPCs, approval routing/password change/sign-out work, and unauthenticated cron requests return 401. The synthetic production verification account was removed; no existing customer records were purged. A smoke-test assertion was corrected to match denial messages case-insensitively before the successful rerun.

## Automatic screenshot cleanup scheduling

Migration `202609300005_cleanup_status.sql` is additive: `bid_purge_status` gains `serverTime`, `nextAttemptAt`, `processingFiles` and `awaitingRemovalFiles` (existing keys keep their meaning, except `failedFiles` now excludes tasks a worker currently holds), `retry_bid_cleanup` skips live leases, and `has_due_storage_cleanup()` lets the scheduler skip idle minutes. Deploy the app and migration together; older clients ignore the new keys.

The app polls status read-only. Cleanup itself no longer depends on an open browser: a Supabase Cron job runs every minute and calls the authenticated `/api/cron/storage-cleanup` endpoint through `pg_net` only when due, unleased tasks exist. The endpoint drains up to 20 batches of 50 files (or 40 seconds) per call. Leases (two minutes) make overlapping calls safe. The five-minute verification delay is unchanged, so a removed screenshot completes within about a minute after it becomes eligible. The daily Vercel cron stays as a backup.

Per environment (staging first), as the project owner, outside `supabase db push`:

1. Create the Vault secrets listed in `supabase/scheduler/storage-cleanup-schedule.sql`: the environment's endpoint URL, its `CRON_SECRET`, and on staging the deployment-protection bypass.
2. Run `supabase/scheduler/storage-cleanup-function.sql`, then `supabase/scheduler/storage-cleanup-schedule.sql`. Both are idempotent.
3. Monitor with the queries at the end of the schedule file (`cron.job_run_details`, `net._http_response`). Worker logs contain counts only, never file paths.

Staging acceptance: `SMOKE_VERCEL_BYPASS=<automation bypass> node --env-file=.env.staging scripts/cleanup-schedule-acceptance.mjs`. With no browser open, it purges 61 synthetic applications with real screenshot objects through the database RPCs. It simulates an upload landing after the first removal, then waits for the scheduler alone; it never advances timestamps or calls the worker. It asserts the unauthorized 401, first removal within about two minutes, the five-minute verification wait and removal of every object, then deletes its synthetic accounts and files. For production, deploy the same way and confirm the existing pending operation completes through its queued task; do not create another purge or mark work complete by hand.

`CRON_SECRET` is a Vercel _sensitive_ variable, so `vercel env pull` returns a placeholder, not the value. Take the Vault value from the operator's secure record (`.env.local` for production, `.env.staging` for staging). A mismatch shows as HTTP 401 rows in `net._http_response`.

Release 2026-10-01: commit `602c190`, production deployment `dpl_3dWRXZFmTN6R8yJ31tgzfgh9PamM`; staging preview `dpl_GjkvcPuutFTgcXZyMZBdyQQK1AA4`. Migration 202609300005 is applied in both environments, and both have the `storage-cleanup` Supabase Cron job (every minute) with Vault secrets.

Verification:

- Local: 77 unit/database tests, browser tests (one pre-existing intermittent spreadsheet-focus case unrelated to this change), lint, type checking and production build.
- Staging real-delay acceptance: 61 files removed by the scheduler in 32s, including a late upload, and verified 391s after deletion. No browser was open and no manual worker call was made.
- Staging hosted smoke: all 16 checkpoints passed.
- Production: the one existing pending task from the 2026-09-30 8:04:13 PM CT purge completed through its queued task at 12:07:01 AM CT, on the first scheduled call after the secret correction. No unfinished tasks remain. No purge was created and nothing was marked complete by hand.
- Production smoke checks passed, and its synthetic account was removed.

## Shared profiles, bid restrictions, retention, and legacy-library reset

Migrations `202610040001`–`202610040009` add shared candidate profiles, bidder-specific resume assignments, profile-wide bid restrictions and retention aggregates, a checked reset inventory, and a temporary write gate for the cutover. Keep `.env.staging` pointed at the isolated staging project. The staging hosted smoke uses only synthetic accounts and performs a scoped reset of its synthetic workspace; it verifies both immediate Storage removal and the delayed second pass. Never point that smoke script at production.

The production cutover tool is intentionally guarded and does not print account addresses or file paths. After applying the schema and deploying the production app, take an inventory with:

```powershell
.\node_modules\node\bin\node.exe --env-file=.env.local scripts/application-library-cutover.mjs --environment=production --inventory
```

The command reports counts and an inventory fingerprint covering all workspaces, workspace settings, application-library rows, aggregates, and workspace-scoped private Storage paths. The authorized reset requires that exact fingerprint and the fixed confirmation phrase; it briefly pauses library writes, rechecks the inventory while locked, removes only candidate profiles/assignments/applications/history/aggregates, preserves accounts/workspaces/memberships, resumes writes after the empty-state check, and waits for cleanup of the captured old Storage paths:

```powershell
.\node_modules\node\bin\node.exe --env-file=.env.local scripts/application-library-cutover.mjs --environment=production --reset --expected-fingerprint=<inventory-fingerprint> "--confirm-reset=RESET ALL APPLICATION LIBRARY DATA"
```

The production cleanup origin defaults to `https://bidder-check.vercel.app`, so a local-development `APP_URL=http://localhost:3000` cannot redirect the cutover worker to localhost. Set `CUTOVER_APP_URL` or pass `--app-url=https://<production-domain>` only when the deployed production domain changes. The script refuses a changed inventory, a different Supabase project, a missing active admin, or a missing `CRON_SECRET`. If database deletion succeeds but Storage verification is still pending, resume without repeating the reset:

```powershell
.\node_modules\node\bin\node.exe --env-file=.env.local scripts/application-library-cutover.mjs --environment=production --verify-cleanup
```

Release 2026-10-04: migrations `202610040001`–`202610040009` applied to production. Deployment `dpl_9p1e6z4Fxwd5u6DTGmMWVZFPSXXy` published the shared-profile workflow; deployment `dpl_Ew8mM5XtMmB5RZKRMc8AJbCpAggy` added cleanup failure-phase logging. The authorized reset removed 2 shared profiles, 2 assignments, and 2 resume PDFs from 2 workspaces; there were no bids or earnings. It preserved all 3 accounts, both workspaces, and the bidder membership. The write gate is off, the application library is empty, all queued Storage verification tasks completed, and the production cleanup endpoint returned HTTP 200. A first local cleanup-tool attempt used the development `APP_URL`; the database reset remained successful, and the production scheduled worker completed the delayed verification. The tool now targets the deployed domain and supports cleanup-only recovery.

## Production admin-only reset

On 2026-10-05, the requested Production reset superseded the earlier reset state above. It preserved only the active Auth account and profile for `david.chan.mdev@gmail.com`; it removed the other 3 Auth users, 2 workspaces, 1 bidder membership, and all other application rows. Before the reset there were no bids, resumes, shared candidate profiles, file records, or Storage objects. The completed cleanup tasks and prior application reset audit were also cleared. Post-reset verification found exactly 1 Auth user and 1 active admin profile, with no workspaces, bidders, applications, resumes, files, messages, inbox notifications, or Storage objects. The application-library write gate is off. Production Cron, Vault secrets, Storage bucket configuration, schema, and migration history were retained; every local migration through `202610050003` is applied.
